Strategic Prioritization\n- Prioritize customer-facing information\n- Ensure critical processes rank highest\n- Balance between different service areas\n\n### 2. Regular Review\n- Review priorities quarterly\n- Adjust based on customer feedback\n- Monitor search result effectiveness\n\n### 3. Content Quality\n- High priority = high responsibility\n- Ensure accuracy of prioritized content\n- Keep high-priority files updated\n\n### 4. Keyword Optimization\n- Include comprehensive search keywords\n- Add relevant alias terms\n- Define clear use cases\n\n## Testing Priority Changes\n\n### 1. Server Restart Required\nAfter changing priorities:\n```bash\n# Stop the server\n# Restart with: node index.js\n```\n\n### 2. Test Search Queries\nTry searches related to:\n- \"key4\" or \"student banking\" (should show key4 banking file first)\n- \"investment\" (should show investment file first)\n- \"banking services\" (should show services file)\n\n### 3. Monitor Logs\nCheck server logs for:\n- Document loading confirmation\n- Priority assignments\n- Search result rankings\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Multiple File Coordination\n- **Complementary priorities**: Different aspects of same topic\n- **Hierarchical structure**: General → Specific information\n- **Seasonal adjustments**: Temporary priority boosts\n\n### Search Result Impact\n- Priority affects **relevance scoring**\n- Higher priority documents appear **first**\n- Maintains **content relevance** matching\n- Balances **priority** with **search accuracy**\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Priority Not Working\n1. Check YAML syntax\n2. Ensure server restart\n3. Verify priority range (0.1-10.0)\n4. Check for parsing errors in logs\n\n### Unexpected Results\n1. Review search keywords\n2. Check content relevance\n3. Verify priority values\n4. Test with different queries\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n### Planned Features\n- **Category-based priorities**: Different priorities per topic\n- **Time-based priorities**: Automatic priority decay\n- **Usage-based priorities**: Priority based on access frequency\n- **A/B testing**: Priority effectiveness measurement\n\n---\n\n**For technical support**: Contact the development team\n**For content updates**: Follow the priority guidelines above",
