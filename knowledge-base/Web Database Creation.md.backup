          Headquartered in Zurich and Basel, UBS was formed through a 1998 merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, yet today operates worldwide across major financial centers including the U.S., Europe, and Asia  
        * **Strong corporate governance and transparency**  
          The site features dedicated sections on corporate governance, organizational structure, and executive leadership and provides access to annual reports, AGM timelines, and investor resources

          UBS highlights its people and culture via sections on employees and DE\&I, underlining its commitments to diversity, inclusion, and workplace values across global operations.  
      * A bank like Switzerland  
        * **Positioning UBS as a reflection of Swiss identity**  
          The campaign underscores UBS’s strong alignment with Swiss values—such as responsibility, reliability, and conservatism—rebranding as “A bank like Switzerland,” emphasizing national pride and authenticity.  
        * **Commitment to long‑term civic and social responsibility**  
          UBS highlights its role as a major supporter of Switzerland’s cultural, vocational, sports, and social development—promoting youth empowerment through initiatives like UBS Kids Cup and partnerships with SwissSkills and ETH Zurich.  
        * **Integrated launch strategy with broad visibility**  
          The campaign is rolled out across TV, cinema, social media, digital channels, print, and UBS's own touchpoints (e‑banking, branches), ensuring cohesive messaging nationwide in three phases.  
        * **Personal and aspirational storytelling**  
          UBS deployed a six-part social media series sharing real individuals’ hopes and aspirations—linking their personal stories to national progress and the bank’s role in helping future generations thrive.  
        * **Collaboration with a Swiss creative agency**  
          The campaign was produced by Fraser (Schweiz), marking a creative milestone for both UBS and the agency—with high-quality visual storytelling reflecting shared Swiss heritage.  
      * Commitment to football  
        * **Celebrating Swiss football talent at home Euros** – UBS’s initiative supports and promotes young football talent across Switzerland as the country hosts the European Championship, reinforcing its ongoing role as a champion of national sport development   
        * **"Turning dreams into opportunities" for girls’ football** – The campaign amplifies UBS Football for Girls programs such as Doppelpass and UEFA Playmakers, backed by expanded funding and events to help girls nationwide try football and build early engagement pathways   
        * **The new Kickstart toolbox** – Developed with the Swiss Football Association, this resource includes 25 drills, themed cards, posters, and stickers designed to help schools and clubs introduce girls to football in playful, inspirational ways  
        * **Engagement beyond the pitch** – UBS reinforces that football is more than a game—it’s a driver for empowerment, opportunity and personal development, supporting broader initiatives around education, inclusion and financial literacy in Switzerland   
        * **Exclusive promotion campaign** – Visitors to the microsite are invited to participate in a competition to win unique branded memorabilia, such as an XXL jersey blanket that isn’t available commercially—emphasizing fun, premium engagement  
      * Cyber Security at UBS  
        * **Robust, multilayered cybersecurity framework**  
          UBS employs a comprehensive information‑security program aligned to the seven functions of the Cyber Risk Institute’s Cyber Profile: govern, identify, protect, detect, respond, recover, and extend. It includes administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, overseen by senior governance and regularly assessed internally and externally  
        * **24/7 global monitoring & rapid incident response**  
          The firm operates a Cybersecurity Operations Center that continuously monitors for threats, correlates security events, triggers alerts, and enables swift response and recovery efforts to preserve business continuity   
        * **Emphasis on third‑party / supply‑chain risk**  
          UBS recognizes that external partners (vendors, service providers) pose risks. Its strategy includes assessing and monitoring third‑party security capabilities, and acting swiftly if incidents occur—even referencing the June 2025 Chain IQ supply‑chain breach affecting UBS (no client data exposed)   
        * **Awareness of evolving threat types—phishing, deepfakes, ransomware**  
          The content warns about executive-targeted “whaling” attacks, phishing, ransomware, social engineering, and the emergence of AI-based deepfake scams used to impersonate voices or senior executives. UBS offers guidance on how to detect and avoid these‑ e.g. checking for unnatural blinking or robotic audio in deepfake calls   
        * **Guidance for individuals and companies on proactive hygiene**  
          UBS provides a clear set of recommended behaviours: always question unsolicited requests; avoid clicking unknown links or attachments; use strong, unique passwords and enable multi‑factor authentication; secure networks (e.g. routers with WPA2, use VPN instead of public Wi‑Fi); back up data regularly; control social media sharing; and in times of crisis, verify sources before donating or responding
