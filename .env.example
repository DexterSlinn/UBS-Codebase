# Environment Variables for Production Deployment

# Backend API Base URL (required for production)
# For local development, this can be left empty (will default to localhost)
# For production (Vercel), set this to your deployed backend URL
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-api.herokuapp.com

# Example for different deployment platforms:
# Heroku: https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com
# Railway: https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
# Render: https://your-app-name.onrender.com
# Custom domain: https://api.yourdomain.com

# Note: The VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to expose the variable to the frontend
# Make sure to set this in your Vercel environment variables
